Pre-build libraries
-------------------
Put the following pre-build libraries into this directory.
Current API version 5.1.4

libkinova_cmd:  Corresponds to Kinova.API.USBCommandLayerUbuntu.so, same code.
libkinova_comm: A copy of Kinova.API.CommLayerUbuntu.so.

The original Kinova.API.CommLayerUbuntu.so is needed by the renamed
libkinova_cmd, as the filename of this library is hard-coded in the binary and
looked for at startup by dlsym calls.
